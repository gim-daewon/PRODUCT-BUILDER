# Lotto Number Generator

## Overview

This application is a simple and visually appealing web-based tool for generating random lottery numbers. It provides users with a set of unique numbers for lottery draws, presented in an intuitive and modern interface.

## Project Outline

### Style and Design

*   **Layout:** A clean, centered layout that is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
*   **Color Palette:** A vibrant and energetic color scheme will be used. The background will have a subtle texture.
*   **Typography:** Expressive fonts will be used to create a clear visual hierarchy (main title, generated numbers, etc.).
*   **Components:**
    *   **Number Display:** Generated numbers will be displayed in styled circles.
    *   **Button:** The "Generate" button will have a modern look with a clear call-to-action and interactive feedback (e.g., a "glow" effect).
*   **Visual Effects:**
    *   **Shadows:** Soft, deep shadows will be used on the main container and button to create a sense of depth.
    *   **Animation:** The numbers will appear with a subtle animation to enhance the user experience.

### Features

*   **Number Generation:**
    *   Generates a set of 6 unique random numbers.
    *   The numbers are within the typical lottery range (e.g., 1 to 45).
*   **User Interface:**
    *   A single "Generate Numbers" button to trigger the number generation.
    *   A clear display area for the generated numbers.

## Current Plan

*   **Task:** Create a lottery number generator website.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **HTML (`index.html`):** Set up the basic structure of the page, including a title, a container for the numbers, and a generation button.
    2.  **CSS (`style.css`):** Apply modern styles to the page for a bold and beautiful visual design. This will include styling the layout, typography, number display, and button.
    3.  **JavaScript (`main.js`):** Implement the logic for generating unique random numbers and displaying them on the page when the button is clicked.
